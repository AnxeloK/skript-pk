# Skript-PK

A Skript addon designed to seamlessly integrate **ProjectKorra** abilities and mechanics into Skript. This plugin enables server administrators to interact with ProjectKorra's bending system through Skript syntax, allowing for custom scripting of bending-related actions, presets, and player management.

Current version: 2.0 (refreshed naming consistency, typed `%ability%`/`%element%` syntax, sub-element support, and lifecycle cleanup).

## Overview

This addon acts as a bridge between Skript and ProjectKorra, providing syntax to:
- Manage bending abilities and player presets.
- Toggle bending mechanics for players.
- Retrieve bending-related data for use in scripts.
- Register custom ProjectKorra abilities directly from Skript scripts.
- Manipulate ProjectKorra temp blocks and cooldowns through Skript effects and expressions.

Designed for simplicity, it empowers server owners to create unique bending experiences without direct plugin modification.
